Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Which background database should I use? 
A: It doesn't matter! AutoLCA works with all background databases as long as one conditions is met: the background database can be evaluated with the impact method you have chosen.

Q: Which impact method should I use?
A: It doesn't matter either! AutoLCA works with all impact methods as long as one ondition is met (again): the impact method can be evaluated with the backgroun database you have chosen.

Q: The background process name has changed in the background database. How should I update it in the AutoLCA template?
A: We suggest the use of cross-references (using"=") in the LCI_SHEET1 to link the column process with the processes in LCIA_1U. Then, you will only need to change the name of the background processes (and values) in the LCIA_1U sheet.

Q: I want to do two parallel assessment at the same time because I have two similar systems, is that possible?
A: Yes, we have created a version of the AutoLCA script that is already programmed to run two systems (AutoLCA_2X.R - available in Github too), you will only need to duplicate the LCI_SHEET1, change the name of the new sheet to LCI_SHEET2 and update your LCI information. The R script needed then is called AutoLCA_2X.R and you just need to ask us to have it.

Q: What if I want to do three parallel assessments?
A: In this case we recommend you two run three times the script refering to three different AutoLCA_EXCEL files. To do that, just save the three different AutoLCA_EXCEL files in three separate folders, triplicate the script and change the working directory in each of them (first lines of the script) to tell R to search for the specific excel file in the folder you want.
